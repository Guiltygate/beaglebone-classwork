README for Homework 04

All functions behave normally.

GPIOs are fixed at 31, 38, 48, and 51, as I used the IO sub-function provided in Lighttracker.c. The toggle GPIO can be changed, though if no argument is given, is fixed at GPIO14. The AINs default to 0 and 1, but can also be set by the user.

There is one problem, a hardware problem- one of the LEDs is always reading 500mv lower than the other, until the flashlight gets so close, then it reads normally. Because of this, some odd things can happen during tracking- it does work, but not optimally, and may have difficulty tracking if the flashlight is really close or really far.
