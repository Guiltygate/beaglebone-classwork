As mentioned before, matrixLED.js uses a connect() function defined within itself to link with the browser. The critical piece here is the io socket, which we can see also used in boneServer.js to a similar purpose, that is communication with the browser for passing input/output data.

More specifically, the majority of the boneServer.js are a series of socket.on() functions, each given two params of 1) a string name and 2) a subfunction function().

2------
It appears that as a user pressed the LED buttons in the browser, a text version of the matrix configuration is sent back to the bone, which uses that to update the matrix column by column.

3------
If by the LED color, you mean the color of the LED symbols in the browser, that is defined in the .on{}.

4------
It seems that all the work that needs to be done will take place in matrixLED.js. With some changes to the function matrix(data) and some GUI work for the browser, should be done. Probably harder than it sounds though.

5------
Nope, no changes made to boneServer.js
